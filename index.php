          Where education is the basis of the economic development of the
          country, technical education is the main basis. The Polytechnic
          established in 2075 is located at Waling Municipality â€“ 13,
          Syangja. The establishment of this school is aimed at developing
          the skills of Nepali youth entering the labor market from the
          surrounding areas of Syangja district through technical education
          and vocational training programs.
          The three-year Diploma in Information Technology  program is
          being conducted at the school, which started with a short-term
          (390 hours) training programs based on the curriculum of the
          Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training at five
          different local levels in Syangja district. Other short- and long-term
          programs based on local demand will be added in the future.
          Preserving the environment for the next generation and using
          information technology in educational activities are the challenges
          of the present generation. Our specialty is to make full use of
          technology in teaching and learning activities to turn these
          challenges into opportunities.</p>
